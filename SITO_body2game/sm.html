                    <strong>Multiple sclerosis</strong> (MS) is a <strong>chronic neurological disease</strong> that affects the <strong>central nervous system</strong>, meaning the <strong>brain</strong> and <strong>spinal cord</strong>. In simple terms, MS is an <strong>autoimmune disease</strong> in which the <strong>immune system</strong> mistakenly attacks the <strong>myelin</strong>, the substance that <strong>covers</strong> and <strong>protects</strong> the <strong>nerve fibers</strong>. This damage creates <strong>scars</strong> (<strong>sclerosis</strong>) and disrupts <strong>communication</strong> between the <strong>brain</strong> and other parts of the <strong>body</strong>.

                    There are different forms of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>:  
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS)</strong>: This is the most common form of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>, characterized by periods of <strong>symptom exacerbation</strong> (<strong>relapses</strong>) followed by periods of <strong>remission</strong>, during which the <strong>symptoms</strong> may decrease or disappear completely.  
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS)</strong>: This form of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong> initially develops as <strong>relapsing-remitting MS</strong>, but over time progresses into a <strong>progressive phase</strong>.  
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Primary Progressive MS (PPMS)</strong>: This form of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong> is less common and manifests as a <strong>steady progression</strong> of <strong>symptoms</strong> from the start, without obvious periods of <strong>remission</strong>.

                    The <strong>diagnosis</strong> of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong> is a complex process that requires a combination of different <strong>methodologies</strong> to obtain a clear and accurate <strong>clinical picture</strong>. This process includes a series of <strong>clinical examinations</strong>, <strong>advanced imaging techniques</strong>, and <strong>specific laboratory tests</strong>:  
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Clinical Examinations</strong>

                    <br>
                    - <strong>Fatigue</strong>

                    - <strong>Cognitive difficulties</strong>  
                    <br>
                    In addition to these main <strong>symptoms</strong>, <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong> can present with a wide range of other <strong>signs</strong> and <strong>symptoms</strong>, including <strong>muscle spasms</strong>, <strong>pain</strong>, <strong>numbness</strong>, <strong>speech problems</strong>, <strong>mood disorders</strong> such as <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>, and <strong>difficulties</strong> in controlling the <strong>bladder</strong> and <strong>bowel</strong>.

                    <strong>Treatment</strong>: There is no <strong>definitive cure</strong> for <strong>MS</strong>, but there are several <strong>therapies</strong> that can help manage <strong>symptoms</strong> and slow the <strong>disease progression</strong>. These include <strong>disease-modifying drugs</strong>, <strong>symptomatic treatments</strong>, and <strong>rehabilitative therapies</strong>.
