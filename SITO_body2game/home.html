                    We are four students from class <strong>4A Rob</strong> at the Technical Industrial Institute “Mario Delpozzo” in Cuneo: Matteo Risso, Michele Giraudo, Mattia Valfrè, and Daniele Revello. We have had the <strong>honor</strong> and the <strong>responsibility</strong> of working on this project dedicated to people affected by <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>. Our project aims to <strong>support people with multiple sclerosis</strong> by transforming <strong>physical and cognitive rehabilitation exercises</strong> into more <strong>relaxing</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong>, and <strong>effective experiences</strong>. We want to approach this topic with the right balance of <strong>sensitivity and positivity</strong>, in order to <strong>reduce stress</strong> and improve the <strong>quality of life</strong> of patients.

                    The <strong>goal</strong> of this <strong>project</strong> is twofold: on one hand, we want to raise <strong>public awareness</strong> about this <strong>complex</strong> and often <strong>little-understood disease</strong>; on the other hand, we aim to develop <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> that can concretely improve the <strong>daily life</strong> of people affected by <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>. We have chosen to focus on <strong>therapeutic games</strong>, because we firmly believe that <strong>play</strong> can be a powerful means of <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>mental rehabilitation</strong>.

                    Our project includes four <strong>games</strong>, each carefully selected to balance <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>therapeutic benefits</strong>. The chosen <strong>games</strong> are extremely <strong>enjoyable</strong> and <strong>engaging</strong>, with a positive impact both <strong>physically</strong> and <strong>mentally</strong> on the participants. <strong>Fun</strong> is essential to maintain <strong>interest</strong> and <strong>engagement</strong> over time, making the experience <strong>pleasant</strong> and <strong>motivating</strong>. The <strong>games</strong> are developed for the specific needs of people with <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>, stimulating <strong>movement</strong>, <strong>coordination</strong>, <strong>strength</strong>, and <strong>flexibility</strong>, thereby improving their <strong>physical condition</strong> in a <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>relaxed</strong> way. Additionally, the <strong>games</strong> promote <strong>mental well-being</strong> by reducing <strong>stress</strong>, increasing <strong>focus</strong>, and improving <strong>mood</strong>.
